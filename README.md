# ESP8266-Weather-Display-with-Art-Deco-enclosure

This project uses a Wemos D1 mini board along with a 1.8‚Äù Color TFT screen to display the weather forecast. I also designed and 3d printed an enclosure for this project using wood filament! I got the inspiration for this Art Deco style enclosure from an old radio. I wanted a design for the Weather Station that would be unique and somehow artistic, I was bored of the square enclosures without any character. <b>I wanted something to make me feel good when looking at it.</b>

The project connects to the internet and retrieves the weather forecast for my location and displays it on the screen. The project only displays the weather icon, the temperature and the time of the prediction because I wanted a minimal look for this project. Of course you can easily add more information if you wish.
